The blockchain is decentralised but it could be traced by many ways like through the monitoring the all the transaction on owning a node 
But many services are providing them ease like the explorers

1. DX -> Dxchain (https://dxchain.com/) it is a Etherum ERC-20 token

2. For ERC-20 tokens there is a contract address will be present and tokens will be provide from the specific address only

3. https://etherscan.io/token/0x973e52691176d36453868d9d86572788d27041a9 all DX transactions will be mostly from this address 

4. We could manually check the transactions to get the required transaction happened on that day 

5. https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfdef5b6f6dece6b29695b9fd8d0cadaff944876e598fd443125e1f8c2db15160 is the required transaction

Alternative method:

1. there is a site we could check the large transactions (https://whale-alert.io/) with that site we could get live information of the large transactions 

2. by using their api's we could get the information https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ethereum/fdef5b6f6dece6b29695b9fd8d0cadaff944876e598fd443125e1f8c2db15160
