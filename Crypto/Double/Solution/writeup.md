While most ciphers have only 26 combinations to work out, this one has literally thousands, making it very much harder to crack, particularly for very short texts. Because there are so many combinations, rather than using decimal numbers as output, this encryption algorithm uses Base36, which is like Hexadecimal but uses all 26 letters of the alphabet in addition to the digits 0 to 9

here is only one online tool to decode it
simply it is Twin-Hex cipher
